                    while Lausanne serves as its judicial centre. Switzerland’s small size—its total area is about half
                    <br> that
                    of Scotland—and its modest population give little indication of its international significance.</q>

                    Switzerland is bordered to the west by France, to the north by Germany, to the east by Austria and
                    Liechtenstein,<br>
                    and to the south by Italy. It extends about 135 miles (220 km) from north to south and 220 miles
                    (350 km) at its widest <br>
                    extent from west to east. Switzerland’s landscape is among the world’s most unusual, and it has long
                    had to contend with a <br>
                    variety of environmental problems that threaten its integrity. Economic development and high
                    population density have caused severe environmental stress, <br>
                    resulting in pollution and debates over the use of natural resources. During the 1970s and ’80s,
                    ambitious environmental policies were implemented by the cantons <br>
                    and municipalities, and this led to impressive progress on pollution abatement. For example,
                    air-pollution emissions in Switzerland are among the lowest in industrialized countries. <br>
